# # Integrating PyFluent with PyWorkbench:
# This example showcases how to use PyFluent workflow together with PyWorkbench - (Python client scripting for Ansys Workbench).
#
# This example sets up and solves a three-dimensional turbulent fluid flow
# and heat transfer problem in a mixing elbow, which is common in piping
# systems in power plants and process industries. Predicting the flow field
# and temperature field in the area of the mixing region is important to
# designing the junction properly.
#
# This example uses Pyfluent settings objects API's.
#
# ## Problem description
#
# A cold fluid at 20 deg C flows into the pipe through a large inlet. It then mixes
# with a warmer fluid at 40 deg C that enters through a smaller inlet located at
# the elbow. The pipe dimensions are in inches, and the fluid properties and
# boundary conditions are given in SI units. Because the Reynolds number for the
# flow at the larger inlet is ``50,800``, a turbulent flow model is required.

# ## Performed required imports

# x, y, and z values from the mesh in the default SI units of meters. The mesh
# check also reports a number of other mesh features that are checked. Any errors
# in the mesh are reported. Ensure that the minimum volume is not negative because
