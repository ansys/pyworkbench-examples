We import pathlib for handling filesystem paths and os for interacting with the operating system. The launch_workbench function from ansys.workbench.core is imported to start a Workbench session.\n\nNext, launch a Workbench session using PyWorkbench. Different directories are declared, including the client and server working directories, which should NOT be the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we define several directories that will be used during the session. workdir is set to the directory containing the current file. server_workdir, client_workdir, and alternative_target_dir are subdirectories within the working directory.\n\nLaunch Workbench using previous directories:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe launch_workbench function is called to start a Workbench session. server_workdir and client_workdir are set to their absolute paths to avoid any ambiguity in directory locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command demonstrates how to download files from the server using a wildcard. The download_file method is used to fetch all files matching the pattern server1.* from the server to the client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command downloads the entire contents of the server directory to an alternative local directory specified by alternative_target_dir.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis command shows how to upload files to the server using wildcards.

The show_progress parameter is set to False to disable the progress bar during the upload.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis segment sets up a log file for the script execution. The set_log_file method directs the logs to wb_log_file.log, and run_script_file executes a script with info log level. The output of the script is printed to the console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the logging configuration, we first disable the log file using reset_log_file. The console log level is then set to info using set_console_log_level. The script is run again with the same log level, and the output is printed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, the console log level is set to error, making the logging more restrictive. The script is executed again, and only error-level logs are shown.\n\n\n\n"}]
