# # Cooled turbine blade

# This notebook demonstrates the process of using the Workbench client to upload project files, run scripts, start services, and handle output files. 
# It also includes launching PyMechanical to solve models and visualize results.

# First, import the necessary modules. We import `pathlib` for handling filesystem paths and `os` for interacting with the operating system.
