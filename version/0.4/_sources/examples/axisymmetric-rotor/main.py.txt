# # Axisymmetric rotor

# This notebook demonstrates the process of running a Workbench service on a local machine to solve both 2D general axisymmetric rotor and 3D rotor models using PyMechanical. 
# It includes steps for uploading project files, executing scripts, downloading results, and displaying output images.
